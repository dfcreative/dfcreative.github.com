  <li>Write code as if you write it for ages. You won’t trust defective code. It isn’t interesting even to read one. The simpliest way to do that - make formal model, that won’t change. Rely on things that you can be sure in.</li>
  <li>Do not treat programming as business-instrument. Make fun, not serious things. Remember university projects: they all were fun, not goals. You was developing schemes, variants of architecture. You enjoy the process, not make your own weight. It’s really demotivating making own weight in arguments and humiliating others. It’s demotivating making serious things. Nobody need seriousness. Use positive instruments to motivate. Simple test: if you count hours at work, go out.</li>
