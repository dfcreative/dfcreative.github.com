<p>Lebedev <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/1401690.html">said</a> right: you have to live for yourself. I’ve made enough decisions in my life that I don’t want to. More such decisions I made — more I become uninteresting, insipid man with no friends, interests and a lot of addictions.
The <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080430185738AA3rKsd">other source</a> tells that to keep my interest and self-satisfaction on due level I should periodically think of my life interests. Free will that I have is only thing that forms my character and my life, and it depends on my mind freedom to challenge to myself.
I understood that challenges is a rocket fuel for me. Analyze synton: go to the courses — challenge. Choose girl (Annita) — challenge. Make work in 5 mins — challenge. Meet beautiful girl (Stacy) — challenge. Go with Kostya to the conference — challenge. Meet Sasha on IT-forum — challenge. The best things in my life happened because of challenges I made to myself, notice — not only scrupulous work.
To posess a girl is always a challenge for any man. Life is fuck booring without a challenge. Is there girls you would like to fuck in fantasy? Yes. Means that the same girls you’d fuck in real.</p>
