Using any JS-next now is pure pain.

### 1. Traceur
It’s weird compiler, which:

* - Cannot be used as a library, causing gulp-traceur or grunt-traceur to fail. You can only use it as a CLI tool.
* - Can’t compile source code without it’s own additional `traceur-runtime.js` dependency. Which is hopefully avoidable in future.
* - Has no way to define prototype-level variables, like `class N { public someVar}`, as it [ES6 spec](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:classes#member_modifiers) offers. So you can’t write high-quality code.
* + Supports source-maps
* + Open-source
* + De-fecto standard
* + Implements the most recent standard
* + Syntactically sugared
* + Comunity-supported

### 2. TypeScript

* - Proprietary technology
* - Narrow non-github community
* - Vague docs/motivation
* - Not necessary ES6-compliant
* - Can partly repel your audience.
* - Still no prototype-declarations
* + Tempting features
* + Speed


### 3. ES6 shims

* - Only features, not classes

### 4. ES6 transpiler

* - more buggy than traceur

### 5. Sweet.js

* + custom macros, even non-standard ones
* - lots of work to make it work
* - custom language patterns


# Class declaration requirements

1. DOM extensibility `class A extends HTMLElement { ... }` (traceur feature)
2. Inner public and static declarations with properly pointing this:
`static defaults = {}`,
`public states = { default: { before: this.someAPImethodReference } } `
