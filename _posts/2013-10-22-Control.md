Success is about control.

If you let things go, it immanently leads to catastrophe and degradation.

You have to feel pressure, to maintain discipline. If you don’t, you’ll find yourself in a pit of failure.

Be punctilious, disciplined, sober, active, self-sufficient.

Every moment of lazyness you learn to be lazy, to not do things. It leads to the whole failure in your life, as far as success is compound.
Every ate food at night leads to fattening. More fatten you — more illed conditions of your life and more inferiority complexes you have. It raises communication problems, your reputation discredits. Discredited reputation makes you doormat and softie. It leads to decreasing salary and increasing problems at work. Besides, you loosing your friends. You become angry, begin dump your anger at relatives, girlfriend. It hurts your relationships with relatives. You loose your sense of life. You want to kill yourself.

So, be vigorous, energetic, trenchant[?].
