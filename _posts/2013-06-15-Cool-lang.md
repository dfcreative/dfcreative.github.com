*Intuitive*. When you think: "Hmm, this thing, supposedly, should work this way. Let me...", — and as a result it works the way you supposed.

*Montone*. Kind of when some symbol makes only this action and none other. You read and see that this could do only this, nothing other. You think "how to make it", and there’s only one way to make it, you don’t think your head off right solving.
