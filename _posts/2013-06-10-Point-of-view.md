#What’s a point of view?

Your point of view is just a point. In a line.
It’s just your static estimation of situation based on knowledges you’ve got.
The proccess of analytical thinking changes your knowledges, therefore changes your estimation of situation and point of view.
Knowing facts changes your POV in the same way.

It’s kind of feeling based on knowledge. Interesting that feeling’d change too along with changing knowledges.

So don’t trust people who cannot support their POV by facts or enough knowledges, overwhelming yours. They have to be an high experts in an area, otherwise they just juicing by emotions.

Good exlpanation of such feeling: [Robert Schnaider](http://habrahabr.ru/post/182686/) text.
