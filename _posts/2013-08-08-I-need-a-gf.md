I need a girl with social role of a GF, not a wife. I don’t need wife. It’s wrong set of values and views for me.

Awaked, dreamed again cheating to my wife... with my wife. At work. Cannot help myself pushing my dick into her pussy/asshole. She was beautiful new workmate (like Ksenia in reality, but much more seductive). In the middle of the process something flashed. It was a new journalist, captured us through the window. He will blackcmail us. I awaked.

Fuck. How to change social role of Stacy? I want her to be playful, seductive, passionate and sportive, not wife cooking dinner and growing weight.
