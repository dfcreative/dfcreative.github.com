Fun is the most important in coding.
Concentrate on the main fun, do not spend too much time trying to cover code with tests, or to dig into specificities.
Digging into details can pervert your perception, you can begin to think that one things are more important than others, but indeed important is fun.

Concentrate on color picker, forget about everything else. Do not write ideal component, just suite your needs.
