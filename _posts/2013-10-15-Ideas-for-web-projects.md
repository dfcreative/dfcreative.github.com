Feels like I don’t see any sense in developing any web-projects.
Or maybe I see, but only in simple ones, targeted for usual people, not JS developers. Maybe I just tired.

At least I don’t see any possibility to make money from them. What can I do that people will buy?

Extra-convenient service of studying languages?
 	* Useful tests, no Russian at all
 	* List of new studied words with illustrated examples of meaning.
 	* Tons of grammar
 	* Speaking practice

Maybe small & cozy list of studied words?
	* Visual examples
	* Examples of use: real english corpus things
	* Meaning
	* Synonims/antonyms
	* Thesaurus

I suppose I have to do things I like. That’ll prevent any disturbs related with not knowoing what to do.
