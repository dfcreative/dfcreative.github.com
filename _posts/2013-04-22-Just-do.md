Simple answer on many life situations: just do things.
Instead of thinking about life, sense and motivation — just make things.
Instead of hesitating and stopping — just make things.
Simply work. Whatever anybody says, let they grub you, tell you that nobody need it — just do things, something is better than nothing. Let they say you will never do it — just do it.
