Studying language is interesting.

Ideal results I see:

* Conversing with any native speaker easily and naturally, with no any stumbles and delays.
* Easily recognize any audial information, whether it is English accent with english vocab or America, or any other.
* Hanging out with american friends, spending time interesting
* Any phrase or thought you can express on Russian should be as well troubleless expressed in English. Moreover, English version is preferrable in the interests of studying. It’s a good idea to avoid russian sources of information. Just forget Russian for some time, as if it is not your home language.
* You feel some sympathy to the Russian language, russian people etc. When you see Русский in the list of languages, you perceive this as something dear, native. The same feeling you have to attain for english language. It’s very importatn you to get used to english the same extent and even more.
* Any notion, any thing surround you have to be found in english thesaurus. It’s very undesirable to resort to russian notions and terms to describe things. Use english synonims dictionary, avoid any russian remarks.
* Avoid occurences of russian. AVOID russian. Immerse to the world of English.
