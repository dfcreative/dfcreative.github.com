Too much reflections[рефлексивности] on your videos. Be confident. Do not chew (it’s unpleasant for other person). Do not scratch nose, eyes, face. Do not wave your hand and look around. Satisfy basic things for confidence: gum, no smell, nice wearing. If you make fitness - it’s better. Speak ideas, do not stop too long.

Too much of reflection in my head. Too much of how people behave and what they should be and why my life is so difficult. Think about interesting things. Imagine. Do not [зацикливаться] on bad ideas, move on. Think of good and interesting things.
