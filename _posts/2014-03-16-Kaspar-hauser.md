Watched Kaspar Haser, which is of 2013 year.
That film just awaken me.
I got that I’m trapped with circumstances.
No car, no flat, lots of limits.

Fuck.

I want to go to Ibiza. I want dance. I want freedom.
I love that aesthetics.
Programming isn’t sense of my life. That makes me ugly.
I love beautiful girls, beautiful things, sunshine, good music.
I want to spend time with friends.
Tania is a good person to get friends with. If she had a DJ friend, I’d be delighted to spend time with them.
That crazy and easy-going behaviour.
I’m sick of Alex’s criticism and effacement.
I want to be handsome and enjoy dancing.

E-music is my love.

Surrealism is a beautiful.

It’s the reality in the eyes of a man, interpreted reality.
Objectivist pictures is a basic. Fantasy pictures is for kids.
Surrealism shows perceived phenomenons.
