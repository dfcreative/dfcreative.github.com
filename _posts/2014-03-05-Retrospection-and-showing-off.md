I tried to redesign kudago menu a lot, but Sasha’s decision was the key.
Why? What could I do to make that by myself?

It’s good that I collected other’s thoughts on this topic (design of menu): I saw a lot of good/bad examples, approaches to that trouble, ways of thinking.

Technically, I could have a weaponry of different methods of scaling/modifying current design in order to know possible ways of developing. It is very like the advertisement methodic. But as TRIZ shows, it is inefficient. It is better to go straightforward to the goal. But indeed, TRIZ just reduces the circle of options in order to solve one or another trouble by knowing lots of methods and their meta-sense (the way they were invented). TRIZ succesfully solves any kind of trouble you have, but it is not thinking out of the box, it is superefficient strategy.

So the solutions Sasha suggested:

* It is important to show our event categories → make events menu as big as possible.
* It is important to differ restaurants/events menues → make them black/white.
* It is important to make rest menu small → make it as small as possible (no at all?).
* It is important to place banner here → make that extra-menu banner.
* It is important to show company’s identity → place as small distinctive logo as possible.
* It is important to show the city selected → Make it big.

What else? Continue this list.

This shows the minimal important way of thinking. It is more to the defining what is important for you, than to choosing the means you can implement it. Though, combining is important also.
So, design is: thinking what is important; seraching finest solution; ordering & cleaning up. Decorating is about something else.

The fact that lots of girls nake their body parts is very similar to showing off property someone has. "I’m so cool because I’ve bought that jeep". "I’m so cool that I’ve bought that iPhone". It is very banal.

The real beauty is hidden. It is behind the superficial.
