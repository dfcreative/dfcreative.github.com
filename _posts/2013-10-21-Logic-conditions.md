To speculate in an efficient way there have to be conditions of discussion set up.
At first, there shouldn’t be any emotional involvement. Every statement should be done in calm and firm way.
At second, there shouldn’t be any judgements of actions, deeds and points. Judgement is always off the rationality, because you cand judge correctly in the only way - when you have a criterion of truthfullness/efficiency. If you don’t, you can’t say that something is bad or awesome, because it involves your personal attitude. But the correct way of expressing your personal attitude is finding arguments which works against of currect statements. It will build dialog, maybe argueing, but not the quarrel.
At third, there have to be comfort and equality of subjects conditions (equality of statuses) should be provided. If there are not, a conversation may take the form of superficial talks.
At last, there shouldn’t be meta-judging in sense that you shouldn’t punish for getting back to previous questions and desire getting in the root of notions etc.
