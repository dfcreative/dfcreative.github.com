For now, the best methods of machine learning can quite qualitatively handle the same types of works that people do. Decision making, predictions and so on. But people’s methods have absolute quality because of not statistical but analytical, logical approach.

The main difference of people mind from the machine mind is ability to form concepts and rely on them. Concepts can be derived from any source of data.

Significant trouble of people is inability to exist in data-environments, different from natural ones, they’re intensely restricted with imagination. Another problem is inability to exist in non-human physical environments.

A big goal of the whole machine education area is to build so-called agent, or entiny, that’d live in the area inaccessible for the people, form it’s own concepts, manipulate them, be more effective than people in that areas.
