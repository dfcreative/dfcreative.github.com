Kudago is a fucking cancer.

"We have to watch to wordstat and create tags for the top words".

Fuck. Insteadof writing about interesting topics, interesting stuff, write very qualitatively and passionately, interesting and engaging texts, we create "content" for top requests. We do not write interesting content, interesting for us. We do not create tags because they are useful. We create tags for the top requests.

Like, you have to be interested in things which someone told you to be interested in.
