I have to chose the only project to work out to ideal state (set of requirements).
This project should meet the prerequisites:

1. Be able to work out qualitative list
2. Give good PR effect
3. Be quite small, not to spent half of life
4. Increase my and Russiaâ€™s competency level
5. Community-raising
6. Able to get funds
7. Thing of my life
8. Ability to become the best thing of class in the world (image, brand, positioning, vision of a product)

Ideal size is redaktor-like or smaller

## Options

1 - harmful effect
2 - unsatisfactory (not at all)
3 - satisfactory (minimally, somewhat)
4 - satisfactory and even better (good with a shortage, medium)
5 - ideal result (expected)
