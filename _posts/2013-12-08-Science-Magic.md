I always thought that there is some kind of magic in science, engineering. If you learn how do neural networks work, or field theory work, or formal languages work, you’ll be able to do magic things, to understand some depth of nature, whereby you can make all the people happy. But indeed there are no such magic. These areas are just simply tools. There are no magic in math. There are no magic in intellectual algorithms. There is no magic in works of Eiler, Ferma, etc. - there is only exhaustive and fastidious description of knowledge. That can do anybody. That’s simple work. I’d say, you can invent anything, if you want it very much.
Moreover, usually these theories tend to exaggerate their’s significance. It’s better not to think that neural networks or machine learning can solve some problems in a magic, tacid way, only because they’re utterly difficult or built in a way copying nature. There are no magic in conveying sense of natural languages or building parsers - it’s just question of algorithms, not some sort of magic.

A sort of magic may happens only in physics, where you face with insusceptible substances, like magnetism. In biology, where you see how is organics developed. There you always work with some substances, which are different from your own mind.
But programming, math, engineering - these are always applied sciences.
