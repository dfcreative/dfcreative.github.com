#About difficulties in conversation on casual topics

When I was young I used to feel confusion while conversating with people, especially strangers. I thought: what is that skill that allows ones to communicate easily and to ease borders?

Not the most thing, but the very important is that you shouldn’t try to show your interest to the person. There’s no straightforward interest from one person to another. You better find out and choose topics for discussion: that’s exactly the very thing which raises interest to discussion. Man is nothing by itself, but it always has interests in some areas. That areas join people together in communication. The main point of a good speaker is to find that area, that substance, that subject of common interest.

It’s [в той же степени] important for marital relationships.

So, that is exactly that mean which raises discussion and interest.

Other thing is common activity. But it’s much more difficultier to start.
