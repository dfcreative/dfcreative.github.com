In these latter days I found myself facing with the flow of shit happening to my life.

* I have bad relationships on the work: Sasha, Maxim, Lesha. Quarreled to the fucking shits about whether we need to save preferences when you switch settings tabs or not.
	* Lesha if fucking critic, blames anyone efforts, in everything: design, english, whatever else; but he represents nothing by himself: his english is sluggish (I’ve seen far more better, even of russian guys), with artifical accent; his designs is only words and his fucking taste, he can’t do really nice things; his opinion is read from the internet.
	* Max is fucking troll inclined to control everything and be aware of every aspect of not his work. Latent despot.
	* Sasha is also troll, I’ve been discredited before him as a designer.
* I’ve been denied with Canadian immigration.
* My english is sucks.
* My body is fat.
* I feel nerves-based illness.
* I suck at painting good designs, loving beauty and aestethics.
* I feel depressed most of time.
* I have lots of projects, not finished yet.
* I have a lot of unfinished work with family and Stacy.
* I’ve lost my friends: Pasha, Lesha Serov, university.
* I have trouble of communicating with people: i can’t do it easy and without embarassments, thats why i do it not much.
* I've failed almost all commercial projects and failed all business contacts: Sergey Poduzov, Kostya, older cliends.

What’s caused these troubles?

* My commitment and fanatics on the work caused lack of sports.
* Lack of sports caused complexes in meeting friends and conversation.
* My indolence & lacking of confidence caused failures in English.
* My absentminded approach caused not finishing any of my own projects.
* My indolence caused failures in business projects.

* In general, it’s feeling of irresponsibility, letting things go, absent of control, not seeing the scale of potentially causing troubles, that lazyness: as if something will be done by itself, like, sports (absent of control leads to fatness), projects (absent of attention leads to failed projects), relationships (absent of attention leads to isolation and losing friends). Finely made projects won’t solve my these problems.

Right point of view

* Successful man is successful in everything. You can’t be successful in one area, not being successful in other. 
* Leader always solves difficult tasks. Fuck Maxim. Punch his ass out. Do right and serious discussions with Sasha and Misha.
* You are what you can do now. If you even hesitate to call old friend, you’re worse than you used to be. Your diplomas and certificates are nothing. Important is only one: your ability to do the deal right now.
	* Paint
	* Converse
	* Do sports
	* Enjoy designs
	* Fix bad sides of your life

* If you feel that things will sort out themselves - no, they won’t. You have to correct them. If you don’t, it’ll lead you being up to head in shit. Your inactivity guarantees failure.
