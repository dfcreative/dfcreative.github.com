Wishes-Driven-Development is the best kind of development known.
At first, you implement system ideally, as if you had all the means you need to implement that.
At second, you implement that ideal API.

It is maximally short way to do things: you just have to be an expert in Domain area, and it's also desirable to known a lot in general/adjacent areas, that's all.

You don't have to write tests beforehead, know testing methodology, tools, etc. You spend a lot of time to write tests, and then some of them turn out to be irrelevant.
