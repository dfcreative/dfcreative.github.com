Don’t want to do anything. I don’t give a shit to the shitty designs around. Not interested in any changing or making better the world around. People live in shit? Don’t care. Not my business. It’s their choice.

Often I try to see bad features in the girls or relations around. It’s [подсознательно]. [смазливая] girl? Slut. Beauty couple? [не все гладко].
I think, it happens because I try to [оправдать] my own marriage. I don’t love Stacy. At least, I don’t feel that thrill that is usually [свойственен] to a people in love. From many points of view Stacy is a good wife, but it [не преуменьшает] my criticizing attitude to her. It happens [подсознательно, опять-же]. I constantly try to find her [недостатки]. But indeed, I just don’t love her. I think, when I made that decision to begin dating, I was kindof suppressed by the [мнение] of people around. "Luda? Fat and too [сумасбродная]. Where have you found that slut? — told Dima." Parents tried not to influence on my decisions, but have played role. "We were afraid that you’ll choose the wrong girl, like Karina. Stacy is a good girl." That way, I tried to fill expectations of anybody but me.
From the first date I’d understood that Stacy is kind boring and immature. I was feeling that in all the time of developing our relaations. She is kind of coward. She don’t want to challenge herself, she don’t like to work much and develop her own skills. But it’s the negative features again.
I shouldn’t try to [оправдать] my absence of love by seeking the same things around. I should keep with it now.
