I understood that the people which I get on well with are those I respect.

Bad examples:
* I stopped my relationships with Eugenya Smirnova when I stopped to respect her aspirations.
* My relationships with Stacy go down when I cease to respect her. I imagine a perfect wife, and Stacy doesn’t meet criterias.
* Pavel conflicted when I continuously treated him with disrespect.
* There’s no such notion as respect on work, that’s why there’s constantly tense psychological atmosphere.

Good examples:
* Pavel and Annita. I respect htem very much, so when I started to show some disrespect to Annita, they became far from me.
* Alex Buraykin. I respect him as a man. He’s real friend, real man.
* Ruslan Zagirov. He’s really talented brain. Unfortunately, not in right place.
* Vinnik Petr
* Snizhko Elena
