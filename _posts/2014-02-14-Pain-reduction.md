Pain reduction is the main goal which have to be pursued while designing class structure, architecture etc. The main goal is reduction of unnecessary technical actions, maximizing efficiency of code-writing. Ideal code is the one written in a declarative style. When you write your component declaratively, without thinking of how to make one or another thing. It maximizes your code efficiency.

If you need an extra element registering - that means you have to remember that unnecessary technical action. Itâ€™s better to do it automatically, to hook up all possible dependencies without need to manually list them.
