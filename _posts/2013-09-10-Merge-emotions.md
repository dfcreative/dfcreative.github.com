Your convictions and emotional bindings is like a program code in repository.
You have some set of worked out versions of your convictions (your worldvision). That is program code.
These convictions inflicts on your emotions, causes them.

For example, I feel concern about forthcoming upper intermediate test. That concern changes my mental conditons, I have to think in disturbed emotional background.
At the same time, I don’t feel any disturbance testing myself with the same test. I know that it is for gread good, for my skills. It will sharpen my english.
So the point is to merge that feelings, because it is the same action is taken, so feel the same calm as in taking test at home. It’s all lack of self-respect and confidence. Brave and strength man wouldn’t worry about it. He’d pass the test to ensure and to check his skills.

There’s no such concept as wasting time. As far as time is illusion, introduced by people to synchronize lifecycles, you cannot manage it. There’s no such thing you can manage or distribute. There’s only your will and your possibility to actualize your will.
If you have some free time in the evening, that only means you have a possibility to spend it on anything you like (as if you’d do things you don’t like rest of the day). If you say that something was wasting of time, that means you hadn’t done any profits from that, your voluntary act was insuccessful. But in that case you have an experience of wasted time, what means that now you know the reason and sequences.
If you’re a man blaming circumstances or other people of wasting your time, that means you had let things go. You held your will, you did nothing. You cannot blame others, because it was you who did nothing. You elected not to do anything. It was your will to allow things go the way they did. You think you took off your responsibility, but it is self-deception.

Point about program graph. Every program is a graph of states switching from one state by some conditions to another state. It’s like that example of Haskel’s input functions, returning new, changed universe.
The question is about making approach of programming guaranteeing conceptually fail-proof and error-proof way of building sowtware, as Erlang does.
