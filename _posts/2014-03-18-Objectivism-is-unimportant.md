Important is feeling inside you. Objective things are not.

Important is aftereffect of conversation. Remember that beautiful Paulina, tension while conversing.

Remember that beautiful Tania.

Remember that smart and interesting Katia.

Remember that sunshine Stacy.

Important your attitude to design, not the sense or designation of design itself.

Important experience you have while moving to a big goal, not the goal itself.

Important that you beleive in design, not the design itself. Someone may not to pay due attention to the things important to you, so it’s your own choice to beleive in that. It’s a religion. Aesthetics cannot be proved as something objectively valuable. It is known that it makes other people lives better, but it is unprovable. It’s a choice society has to make, to instill value of aesthetics.

But there’re still lots of different important things.

Preserve your feeling, keep naive and foolish position.

Evaluate things and people by your own. Only your value is important, and noone else's.

I have to try talking more with passionate people, great designers & great coders.

You think that making something is unimportant, like running or whatelse. But indeed, important in feeling inside you - that is what makes you live.
