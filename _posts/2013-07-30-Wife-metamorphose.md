#Note about reception of marriage

When I think of my status as of married, I feel strong apathy and no will to live, I find bad and mean things about even beautiful girls around.
When I think of status as of free, as if I were alone and free to relationships, I feel interest to life and find myself paying positive attention to women around, even [одергивающим] stopping helping myself to get acquaint. I find how much beautiful women are. I think how beautiful sunrises are, what a romantic to drive bycicle by the mornings at 4a.m., how beautiful the life is.

How to [совмещать] interest with married life?
