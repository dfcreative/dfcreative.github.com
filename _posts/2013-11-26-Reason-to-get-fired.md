A nice excuse to get fired: I'm sick of indifference to the project.

That Max which behaves like a fat cat, absolutely indifferent to the project and isn't interested in anything but money.

That Alex - a braggart and a cad. He is sometimes an incarnation of mud and evil.

There's nothing I want to do for them, as far as they want to be leaders. Fuck them.

If there is anybody I do for - it is Alexander.

I won't spend my talent for these people, for any money.

Besides, I came here not to get entartained, but do work. Do cool stuff.
