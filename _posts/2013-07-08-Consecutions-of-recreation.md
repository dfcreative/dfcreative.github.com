* Fact that you’ve described fully the Pyramid of Maslow doesn’t mean that it stopped to work. You shouldn’t eliminate the basic princples of human willing and wanting. It’s not just a words, it’s always human’s aspirings lay beyound these words. What do you want? At first, it’s what you want to posess. Second, who you want to be, the role model. Third, the wishful model of behaviour, way of life. And the third is probably the most important. It’s not that important to [окружать] yourself with the things of comfort, gadgets, luxuries. It won’t make any quality step for you life. But to make new vision to the simple things. To view something that nobody can, something more than just reality and objectivism, something extra-real. Beauty.
* It’s that easy to confess to yourself that your marriage isnt’s successful in mathing with a wife as a person. We’re not matching to each other.
* If to throw out any sexual clues and hints [намеки], there’s no so much beauty in the people around. The beauty people who live in harmony. Who is not afraid to do things thich their heart tell them to do. That was the thing tempted and made me passionate and even obsessed in Annita: her smart, brave mind, positive sight to the world. Her well-looking. If to throw her beauty, I’d [врядли] be interested in her.
The posess woman is a very motive for the man. But it’s not in the sexual appealing [привлекательность] [дело не только в]. It’s the complete harmony, not the superficial beauty.
* There’s no any sense to serve things, like beautify world by design. There’s other story beneath these things. Always when you make design, you change some man’s life. You had to aspire to change it. You should aspire to make life of a man batter, to make a man better. It’s the part of serving beauty.
* Rude, prosaic and cinic view to the world gave me the very possibility: understanding the equality of people. The president can nothing more than simple man. But actually there’s a special value in every man around, extra-value. There was such in Annita.
* Reasons I was obsessed with Annita:
	* her beauty
	* her smartness
	* her interests in music
	* her bravity and openess
	* her inner world and interests: cards she collected, books she read, people she talked with
	* her experience
Besides, I could see her as a wife and wanted to have a children, mean dreamed of it with a thrill.
Now I don’t beleive that it possible in any way.
What if it does? Would I feel that same thrill?
Not sure. I think not.
* Serve to the beauty is a worthwhile[стоящая] living position. There is a beauty in every man around.←
