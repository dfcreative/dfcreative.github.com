I have too much of information in my life I donâ€™t care.
I have to focus on only a couple of things, and redice, block, ignore everything other.
That might be:
- Stacy and spending time with her (here comes films and events), walking on the nature
- Current project (stay maximally focused, ignore any irrelevant competitors info) - go to anticafe / one project at a time, no more
- Reading programming digests (once a week = sun/sat)
- Wellness, health and walking

## Rules

- Turn off everything info not related to your goal. If you thought it is one thing, and it turned out to be another - close it, ignore it (articles).
- Constantly ask yourself: does that info is relevant to my goal? To my life? No? Close it.
- Do not listen to the news. Do not watch the TV.
- Make only one thing at a time. It maximizes efficiency.
- Isolate yourself from disturbances while working. Prohibit mother/wife disturb me in work.
