In result of finding the source of depression and sense of life I’ve got an idea of how not to feel depressed and where is sense of life.
There is no sense. You just live, make what you like. There’s no, actually, forbidden actions, there’s only borders of morality: it’s the way of thinking that normal people get used to. You need socialization. Friends have worth. It’s always question of spending time interesting and with result. It’s better if you’ve found partner you’re interesting to be with. It’s question of brevity.
So, we can say, that you can die at any moment, and there shouldn’t be any regrets.
Idk what to say else. There’s just no much sense, what you will do. You can do a lot of useful things. Worls wouldn’t change if you wasn’t.
