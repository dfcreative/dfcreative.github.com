#Simple advice on relationships
Give all you own to the man you chose. If you retain some of your soul posessions, you'll suspect your partner doing the same, you'll begin to look at other variants and doubt your relations. If you give everything you have, the whole of you, you don't leave any place for doubts and jealousy, because you actually will do everything you have and you will be sure there was no other way.
