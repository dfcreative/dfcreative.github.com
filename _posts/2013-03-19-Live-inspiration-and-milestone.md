# I’ve found out two ideas that generally affects on everything in my life.

They come to me in the subway. I was returning home from the english courses and thought: 
— *What age am I?* 
— Twenty five.
— What if I was forty? Suppose *I am forty*. What do I feel? How do I see the world? What do I regret about from my youth?
… I wanted to be confident, self-assured, possible to defend physically and mentally, possible to converse with and persuade any man, with successfull interesting business and thrilling activity at home, like hot sex; knowing languages, playing guitar, warm friends…

*Imagine you are 40.*

And another thing.
I thought: 
— How can I evaluate the worth of things around (I was crazy of design)? I had difficulties with forming my opinion on things. And it’s simple: imagine the best result (how would you do that)? Is that thrills? Is that shit? If thing is close, it’s ok. Same with money aspect: nobody will buy shit. If you didn’t buy that — nobody would.

*** And that’s cool — always when you do something imagine yourself as a person who estimates this (You’re 40. You’re woman.). It’s kind of impressing youself.

*** Besides, nobody interested in substandard work. Do things qualified, as if you  were looking on it 40 years after. Works should be concise, perfect.
