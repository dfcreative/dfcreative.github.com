#Hi there

1. Leave comfort zone, often. All the things that are embarassing, difficult and being appreciated lies abroad of comfort zone. Meet new people, make sports, read books.
2. Restrict your choice. Your life’d be much easier if you have less choice.
3. Take responsibility. There is nobody but you who responsible in your life. If something doesn’t [fits, satisfies] you, only you can change it.
4. Treat business people in win/win strategy, but keep in mind possible looses and harms for the opponents.
5. Make as Paulina in interns: tell yourself that you’ll work here, and treat situation as if you already work here. Treat everything as if you already have that. Anyway, you will have that in the long run, so what’s the reason to lenghten way to obtain it?
6. Decide who’s your friend and who isn’t beforehead. Don’t trust man if he was rude and indifferent to you and then become such. Don’t trust egoists.
7. Be strong person. Don’t try to flatter anybody. Tell your truth, trust yourself only.
