I’ve got high today with my good old friend and unexpectedly understood one or two points.
1. I don’t trust to myself. It’s reasonable, i.e. I often want to have adulter with girls behind my wife, and besides I periodically think that my wife isn’t perfect etc., and I understand that I need to persuade myself to do or not to do one or other things, and this situation is something better than if I trusted myself and do what my heart desire, off the bat doing crazy things etc. So, it’s not surprising that I’m so easy-persuasive. So I have to self-motivate to do one things and not to do other.
