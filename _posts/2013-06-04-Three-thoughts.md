# Woman social service
It’d be nice if there was a sex-service kind of when you’re just sitting in the park, some girl come to you to just have a conversation and asks you about your life etc. And then she invites you to her house to have a sex. This may appear[воплотиться] in different scenarious, but the point is that client think that it’s just simple meeting without any [подразумеваний], but actually it’s paid slut.

# My project tasks
I need some place to make my PR more effective. I’ve wrote an article, and it has nothing more than habrahabr-effect. It’d be better to have done in:

* Habrahabr
* Stackoverflow questions PR
* En article on my site
* Likes from all social services
* VK, Fb, Twitter, LJ, geeklist, linkedin etc links from
* Comments on similar topics from google search

Things to make on my site:

* Simple project-previews list
* Target project pages (landing)
* Donation block
* Likes
* Github link
* Docs — on github, my site — only demos.

# Project management
The fact from project development: there’s more trust to projects that have not so far updates. It’s much more trustworthy at moment if project has at least monthly updates. So it’d be a good thing to supply regular updates.
It may be quite luckily resolved if I [совмещу] my habit to change current project activity (kind of booring about old and lengthy projects) to deliver regular updates.
The scheme is next one: my monthly plan is to perform one update to each program from the some set. I choose any project I like from the list and do it.

# About self-assurance based on statistics of opinions
I was kind of frustrated and not sure about my own opinion because of there was Alexey (Voronov) and a lot of other geeks from the technical community with critical attitude who constantly criticized all my thoughts and expressed any indifference about things I told. I thought: why I am too often not right? Maybe there is really something wrong with my ideas?
But habrahabr article showed the real statistics of interest from the people: yes, there are some indifferent assholes, but in common there maybe at least 50% who faved it.
I’ve noticed that it’s quite often thing when someone does not take you seriously, like takes some critical position. E.g. Ivan Micheev, who criticized idea of women social service above: he told that it’s unlikely to happen. But it revealed, as Alex said, that this-like service already exists.
So there’s main sequence of all of this: don’t loose yourself. There’s always people who think the same and who like your ideas. Just do things that you feel right about. Try to enpower yourself, trust yourself, beleive yourself, not get provoked or misleaded. Do things that you beleive you’re supposed to be to.
