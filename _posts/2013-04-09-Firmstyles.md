Every company is so positive, commercial, it’s even sick of them. Why doesn’t anybody make post-apocalyptic firmstyle? In the best case it’s just old-russian. It would be fun to look at apocalyptic posters in subway.
Inspired by skynet internet-provider: their style is [тошнотворное] commercial shit. They easily could do radical terminator style.
