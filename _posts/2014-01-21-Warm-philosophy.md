* Do not get into debts. You’ll devoid yourself with extent of freedom (Slava’s case)

* To be sincere mean not to afraid to get pain.

* Use your possibilities, do not try to jump higher your head

* Do not wait for speaker to start talking, do not ask for his opinion, take responsibility and talk yourself

* Do not talk to someone what to do, do not discuss things, do not complain. Do the best you can, change situation.

* Competency grow is my mission

* Your reactions is mundane, your speculations is banal. Improve yourself, read books, learn concepts.

* Do not try to convince anyone (Alex thinks integrals are useless). Let other's opinion exist. Just observe, do not participate. Use your skills and strength to enhance yourself, not wasting time trying to change others. Change yourself to help others. Your ambitions, though, can interfere with sincere help (you want to make better).

* Which things help to live? Things, full of love, thought, and caress. To repair some broken garniture, to make small enhancement. To the contrary, things which belong to no one, thing of no care - they show other people’s spiritless. Make things full of love. It is no matter which format your love will obtain: important is your passion, your pure caress, pure love.

* Devote yourself to the people.

* Competent person is competent in everything. It is not just only your expertise area. It is every thing from your life: family, appearance, body, friends, places you live in, politeness. People in Russia are incompetent: impolite, rude, uninterested.

* Paradox situation: a blonde in a jeep in fur coat parked across the pedestrian crossing. She is brutally rude: how did she get that money for a jeep? Is that her sense of life? It is bland.

* People in Russia are ambitious and materialistic. They treat money as more important thing than the men. They can do a lot for the man having money, and nothing for a man just because he’s a man.
