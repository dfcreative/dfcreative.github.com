I don’t like the policy kudago makes it’s business.

Instead of encouraging neophytes and small businesses do their interesting stuff, making their own events, we sell content to big players and big businesses. That is not the way things should work. I’d like the graphity master to create an event on the site and lead it, monitor the comments and so on. Kudago should be the mean of connecting organizers with the audience, and the toolkit for organizers to organize their events, be like an incubator, or friendly and nutritive environment for the startups.

For example, I am a designer, and I want to make a master-class. For a small fee I’d like to buy my small blog platform with API on kudago, create an event, spread information about it, invite target people.

Also mind the editor’s trouble: they try too much make unique texts.

Feel of real is the most powerful feeling we can perceive in our life. It is the highest point of sense of life. It is when you listen to the music and feel the author’s emotions as if he is just here. It is when you discuss with the smartest man on the world just right here and right now, but in fact you read book. It is when there are no artifical fiction, when there is a pure reality.
