* Border setting — only you’re in response of your life. Noone and nothing else can change it for you. Live your world.
* As a limiter — check your pushability.
* Paint your wife, then you’ll live with the state of art.
* I want to open my painting studio in CAnada, paint different people scenes.

# Restrict your choice
Less choice - you give more room for your own world. Absorbing all around sources of information just remisses you, you looses yourself, your world. DOn’t. Concentrate on your world, think of your life. Make things better than yesterday. Do one thing at a time. There’s only this thing and you.
