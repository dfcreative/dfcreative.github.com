People like making tools and becoming perfect in that.
They become perfect in dance.
They create snowboards/skiing/trampoline and hone skills in that.
They think up program languages and write great programs.
They think up new area and become perfect in that.
And all that is fun and perfectionism.

Make value, not money. Do not waste time on ambitions of someone who is rather greedy than value-oriented.
