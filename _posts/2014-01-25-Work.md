I think I have to stop wasting time on a deal I don’t like, like kudago.
I have to concentrate on my primary goals with full power. I can’t do some main deal and switch to the other in free time.
I should try getting hired on jobs only for a month, or a couple of months, just to get money for food. And rest of time spent on my own projects. Life is going, and I’ll just lose talent on things I don’t need, on things some stupid client don’t understand and which he will understand years later.
