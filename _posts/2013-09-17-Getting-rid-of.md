Start getting rid of things disturbing you living the life you want.

When you are trying to read some chain of thoughts, your concentration affects the result straightaway. You can note that there's no extra words in well-formed sentences; moreover, concentration shows you the color of sentence, deepens and broadens it's meaning; concentration shows a role of each word, what it's purpose and how does it play within the grammatival rules to convey the sense, the thought behind the sentence.
For the purpose of qualitative educational results, you have to strive to be calm, composed; to feel and understand sense of every word you meet. It is similar to the behaviour described in "Peaceful warrior": you forget about everything and concentrate on the current moment. All your emotions, regrets and excitement are muted. You write[do anything] the way as if there is no anything else, as if it is the only thing in the whole world. It is as if you are in a room with locked door where is nothing but the subject. It is important not to be worried or disturbed by circumstances, to throw any extraneous thoughts.

Listening to other people with attention and sincere motivation to understand what is person saying, to understand the whole situation of the person is disciplining yourself. It consumes a lot of energy, maybe even more than speaking. If you *listen* to a person, you feel that stream of interest. Like as radio-station.

I feel myself as an energetic vampire.

Life always brings some pain. It's better to do it beforehead by yourself than being kept in bad moods. Make sports by the morning, warming and satiating training, it transforms your day.
