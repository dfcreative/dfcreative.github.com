The main and the most pain of web-services is in their’s unreliability: they stop working as soon as there’s no internet. Also, there’s a huge amount of browser’s/web-page bugs and errors, so you have to write very lightweight applications.

That is why if you’re developing web-applications:

1. Use localstorage & appcache to work & load offline
2. Use as simple ways of making things as possible. Images are better than canvas painting.
