Ones where you have no specified goals to achieve, but you have an intention.

Examples

* Make everything to be alright and look perfect
* Make redesign
* Make a project
* Make nice design
* Make adaptive design

Good examples of tasks are oriented on real troubles and things. They’re intensely restricted with conditions.

* Solve right column trouble
* Get rid of waterfall
* Cover all test-cases
* Make site visible on mobile phones alright
* Make block of similar posts
* Resolve this bug
* ...

So the way of solving task is restricting it’s conditions and specifying requirements.
