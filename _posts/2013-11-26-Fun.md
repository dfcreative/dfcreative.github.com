I’m poignantly sad and even desperate now due to a set of reasons. With Max and Alex dispassion on the background, I absolutely don’t share any interests with the people in our company. Moreover, I feel upset each time I come home after conversing with them. They tend to make a toy of any [собеседник], to show a bitter disrespect, which is why I can’t abide them. Just intolerate.

But besides, I have to learn how to make fun in my life, as stupid sims personage does.

What kind of fun I’m ok with?

At first, fun that I’m not ok with.

* Fun of watching TVs? Useless squandering of time. Unless to watch it on different language.
* Fun of talking with people? Recklessly spent time.
* Fun of eating food? It has bad implications of overweight.

Which fun would be an ideal? The one I have both usefullness and joy from.
Which is that?

* Painting. It develops my graphic design skill along with fun and joyful leisure.
* Thinking about improving world and making up ideas. It is always a pleasure to speak with a man, generating ideas.
* Philosophising. It helps to overlook some concepts and views about world, it is usefull, emotional and thrilling.
