0. Realised I’m not a fan of poor black guys stuff like rap, jargone etc. It’s hare-brained and mean.
1. ! Youtube TV-shows teasing black guys:
	* What solarium do you visit?
	* What soap do you use?
	* Where’s your host?
2. ! tower defence of entartaining people staying in line to the attraction to not get them bored while waiting.
3. Was visiting Paris, there were a lot of black guys, selling stuff. Realised, that the significant part of our lives going outside of computer. It’s all about people around = PR. It’s not that much important what product have you done, its the same important how do you present it to other people.
So, your network is important. Ability to get acquainted is important. Ability to make networks and conversate. Not your sitting at the computer. It’s only illusion of importance.
4. Language is natural code for supplying kindof privacy while conversation. It’s a good idea to conversate on different language, as well as write posts to the people of target language audience, hiding posts from people of different language audience and training language at the same time.
5. Want to study languages: French, Deutsch, Spanish, China. They’re extremely popular.
