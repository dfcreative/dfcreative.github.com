It’s easy to get lost yourself. It’s bad to feel than. You loose your friends, cease loving your wife, stop [следить за собой], avoid making sports, obtain new [болезненные] unhealthy habits. You loose strength of you opinion, now your interests are [навязаны] influenced from other people. You become weak.

It’s too easy to loose yourself if you don’t have any bindings to the past, to the present, to the things reflecting you. As psychologists say, you are the set of habits, deeds, thoughts you had, and you should constantly work on yourself, it’s difficult work. 
To not to loose yourself, keep set of things, which will remind you who you was and what was your interests. For me it’s first C++ book I’ve read; my bookshelf I’ve collected, dreaming somewhen to read them all, beleiveng that behind the books there’s another world, world of success and prosperity, world of [мудрости]. Keep valuable things: cards that your friends sent you; photos with your wife and your friends; drive bike sometimes as you used to in some childhood. It’ll remind the whole picture of you.
