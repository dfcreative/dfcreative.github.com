Every awesome project known was made not by commercial motives, but by interest.

1. Apple - Steve Vozniak was making electrical schemes, soldering boards and wires: that was interesting to him, because he wanted to do his own interesting stuff. There Steve Jobs came and transfered this deal to business: he knew how to sell that product, the Vozniak’s deal of life.

2. Github - it’s a project of enthusiasts.

3. Linux - a single person wrote the whole code.

4. Internet - a group of hackers developed networking.

5. ...

Every such great thing was made by interest of a person, not by commercial motives. That way, Alex’s words of criticizing asm.js beginnings or someone’s senseless actions in programming lose weight. Moreover, commercial things are more likely to fail, than based on interest ones.

Besides, work should be done conscientiously: when you’ve done some more than needed. If there was a task on form, you should do the best you can, not just spit simpliest html code. Light, clean and neat design would perfectly fit.
