You cannot force solving immigration problem. It’s the deal which requires [терпение]. The best you can is to prepare, to wait and to be ready. Learning languages [this En is quite awful, French], enhance portfolio & resume, get experience, send issues,do  things make you out-of-usual [?] person.

Studying painting/design is quite the same [? shitty phrase] as studying languages. You learn how to treat elements, to manipulate color and color matches (words and phrases), you begin to feel tensions/mistakes. Difference is that you hardly [едва-ли] can imagine writing result, unlike the painting/design one.

---

Color is always related to content. If you make bright colors in interface, that automatically makes interface the part of content. Something blurry backgrounds are always about content. Interface is always about flat, unnoticeable but functional thigs.

Depth of thought is a very valuable skill. It's one of those skills, along with empathy, imagination etc, which highers quality level of your life and is important for your expertise area. You’d better read a book written by author who understands something extra, the maximum depth of ideas, notions, who perfectly understands the nuances of cliches and doesn’t throw them [направо и налево], as many people even of his area do. It’s the author as Emil Ruder, who’s written the very valuable book - Typography. It’s interesting and easy to read, it’s lucid, clear, bright, relevant and consequent. It’s an quintessence of author’s experience, it’s his best, filtered, prepared and specied [?].
Nobody interesting to read [словоблудие иных] authors, especially if it is simply reflects ordinary thoughts. Authentic thoughts is very important.

Alex forces his individuality to show and intrude within the team. That way he pushes, humiliates, [унижает принижает] other team members. He’s fucking attention vampire. He enjoys being in the center of attentions.

Alex said that my En is awful, even that I can’t express my thoughts. I think he’s asshole. You shouldn’t tell people how shitty they are, if it is not professional expertise. Especially, if you’re an expert in this area. It is only experience deal - quality of your language, and making bad marks you seriously demotivate the man to continue studying and efforts. So you better [терпеливо] correct and make notes, not making any judgements. Otherwise you’re fucking asshole. As Alex is.

How joyful and pleas[кайфово] it is to write anything the way you can express this, without any embarassments and corrections. Fuck. It’s real pleasure. <del>Fuck Alex. He’s fucking psychotic looser.</del>
Be easy in studying language. Be natural. Get rid of troubles, embarassments, being afraid of being assessed. You have right on mistake. It’s the other people who think different, who think you don’t.

Interesting fact: live content nicely contrasts with any flat/modern UI. It’s civilization contrast. It’s very appealing.

Strange thing about files and file systems is that I’m obliged to name files somehow. What if it shouldn’t have name? Sticky notes I make on the table, or some notes I make in my sketchbook - they don’t have names. As well as notes in this blog. I have to create file named according to some predefined format, but I’m stumble when I need to type title. What is it? I don’t have any predefined plan of my essay, It’s just the a of thoughts. The very big luck if I can catch them before they’re ceased. There should not be any embarassments between ideas typed to memory.

! Blog engine name: grafoman!!!

Good name qualities: relevant to content; self-critical; funny; new, original.

You have to devote all day doing one thing. It is much better to devote lesson studying one topic, not the whole bunch of them.
Another idea: make list of questions to study. Like as I need to make for my grammar.

Be something extraordinary. Develop your style. Born new things.
Be something mad and crazy. Don’t afraid of this. Be brave. Do crazy and schizoidic designs. Do things not normal way. Mix things. Do flat-style shadows, but with natural coloring.
