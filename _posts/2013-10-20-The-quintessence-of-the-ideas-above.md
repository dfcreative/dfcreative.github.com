You cannot that simply put your tasks and responsibility areas to the background mode. There’s no that idle mode in your life. Things don’t work that way. If you do, it equals to throwing these things out of your life.
Every task needs to be done separately and throughoutly. 

The basic premise is that you're constantly learning something, and indolence and dilatory lead to learning that, not the completing tasks through fighting laziness [?]. And if you put something to idle mode, you learning bad things.
