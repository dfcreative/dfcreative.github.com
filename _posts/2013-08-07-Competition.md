1. Competition — that’s exactly the thing led me to one or other activitiy. 
I always thought of myself as of a "paranoidal" man, led by the goal in life, commiting all of me to the work, not spreading around. The man, capable to set goal and to get it. My wife was satisfying because she accepted her role as a helping gray mouse, not requiring anything more than I could give.
I’ve got serious demotivation by my failures in project time assessment - that really demotivated me that I’ve spent two-three times much time than I expected, especially along with Max's demotivating truth about it, not beleiving in success. (by fact, I was extensively influenced by the external opinion. That’s bad.)
Competition led me while I studied at the university: there are lot of people with the same starting conditions as of me, and we all have equal chances to win or loose, to succeed or to fail, to make money/projects/position at the end of studying or to get nothing.
Competition led me to meet with girls: there’re a lot of men willing to get acquaint, but only me who ventured. Remember jealous faces of classmates (especially Vadim), having seen that getting acquaint is possible, secretly desiring to do the same.
Competition invigorated me to make first step, to make something that noone can, to make extra-effort, to become better than others.
Competitive way of thinging making my life better: I found a better job, better woman, become better than others. 
Competition makes hope for anyone to get better.
*So, If you want to motivate yourself, place yourself to the competitive conditions.*

2. Your beleifs is the very important you have. It almost forwardly reflects on all the things you doing. Be careful changing them. It may significally change your life. I beleived in my life’s mission: to obtain all I want in my life-circle (I beleived It’s serious and possible to achieve all the things from it. Fuck, it’s really motivating that thought). I beleived that I want to me firm, strong, confident person. That I can make all my projects and then help to people.

4. *Make project by it’s shortest way: minimal working version at first. It’ll stimulate your interest. Long-playing projects may kill your motivation.*
