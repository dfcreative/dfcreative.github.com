Turned out that all the time of our relationships my wife has her own ideas about it. It happened, probably, because of she’s got drunk a bit at her mother’s birthday.

So, the points of her confession are next ones.
At first, her grandmother said her the month before that she'd expected Stacy’s husband to be some lawyer or other powerful and status man. That’s surprised me, cause her grandma seemed quite good to me.
At second, that regretful confession of her mother the day before our marriage was about the same things, she’d expected me to be some status man, she warned Stacy that I’ll be a workaholic and will spend all my time at work, depriving her with attention. Stacy explains that she’s ready for this: some love and some money is better that a lot of love and no money or vice-versa.
At third, Denis, Stacy’s brother, said that I’ve spoiled Stacy’s plans about her succcesful life in Canada. She could’ve easily migrated to the Canada and have found a right husband with career, money and ready for children.
In addition, when Stacy was at Bride’s (in Canada), woman there advised her that she’ll find nice variants to her, and Stacy said there were some interesting men.

Stacy explains that she with her externality easily could find someone more successful, but in that case she would have to correspond to him. Instead, she prefers simple, quiet and trouble-free life, with no significant obligations, like me.
So, behind all the words about love etc, lays cold, money and comfortable conditions of life led approach, that just maximizes her comfort zone. I kind of weakening her will and requirements to her.

That confused me a bit. I’ve decided to write it here and think it later.

That reminds me of situation with Luda, where I thought the same about her. I’ve broken with her by my initiative, because I thought she’s not enough for me. All my relatives thought the same. But Luda was a bit more openess nature, she showed emotions. I’m afraid Stacy can do the same with me.

At least, she said truth. I saw, he can easily lie to someone, making tales with horroble coldness, like zomboed, but indeed she knew exactly all the truth. She felt my passion to the Annita, but haven’t said the word. Now, she make that bad thing with me. Fucking double game, fucking subterranean river from time to time fountaning to the surface.

Life is hard.
