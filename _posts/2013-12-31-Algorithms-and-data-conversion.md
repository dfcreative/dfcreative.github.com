After writing ending table builder, I began to understand that data-conversion and data-format types are extremely unimportant. Algorithms itself are much more interesting and can offer some business-value, but not much. In that way, parsers/readers/converters have very low value. They are just technical things, there are nothing in them.
So that way, you can safely ignore which format are your data described, juust more universal is more cool and reliable. You better think on versatility and idea of your algorithms. Algorithms by themselves just offers set of actions youâ€™d do on simple data sets, but automated very much, which way you can not to analyze or transform data manually, but to launch an algorithm once. In some extent, you could just record a set of actions to repeat automatically = simple algorithms. In higher extent, your algorithms can obtain intellectual qualities, where they make some decisions with your data. But in every case they just repeat human actions. It is always replacement to a human. In that way, the cost of your algorithm equals to a cost of an employee making the job this algorithm does.
It is always about business-thinking.

Interesting, is it the same for markup/html? What is important here?
