1. If you haven’t made pull-ups today, that’s a red bell that something went wrong about you, you began to miss yourself. The same with memrise and graffiti.
2. Everything good in life is leaving out of comfort zone, efforts on yourself. Make little brave things. Be at maximum of yourself. Do not waste time.
3. Make information and choice isolation. Huge choice decreases interest and involvement. It’s much better to have no choice than have abundance. A [video](http://vimeo.com/66294748) to the subject.
4. I see the picture of my life that I am satisfied with. I lay on the hommack, in the quiet garden of a house of mine, programming interesting shit by the evenings related to my business. I have a lot of friends: they are a good people, interesting, inspiring. They periodically visit us. I have a car: cheap, but comfortable. I have a children and my wife, Stacy, in the house. Periodically I visit some group of friends in the city, like artists meeting.
