Passed IELTS courses [entering] test.

There was discussion with old Cambridge professor, asking questions on topics I should know.

Understood all his questions, but failed quite serious in natural grammar.
Disturbance indeed interferes with education. To study effecient and effective, I should be calm, confident and [степенный].
If I don’t, I’ll miss important points, misunderstand or not fully understand things.

It’s ideal scenario of studying process.

What is ideal language skill level? It’s confident, calm conversation with a native speaker.
Ideal knowledge of grammar. Any trouble gets extricated quite easy.

Any discipline has things have to be learnt by heart and memoize.
Grammar in languages. Thesaurus.
Basic painting skills in illustration and design.
Blind keystroking in programming. Basic terms on the tips of the fingers (cycles etc).
Physical fitness in sports.
Solving polynoms in mind in math.
Knowing gammas in music.
