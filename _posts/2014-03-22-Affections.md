Affection is as well important in life as the reason.

> Stop listing important things (last 15 blog entries), demonstrate importance

I’ve been led by the reason only for the last 5 years, since I’ve got to the university.

> Your English is awful. It is better to learn bland proper writing than grammar-prone one.

I’ve been trying to reason my bad feeling towards Stacy, tried to understand what do I have to do to change the situation. Time after time I was evaluating Stacy’s qualities and trying to settle my concern down.

I relied too much on reason than on a feeling. Though, feelings create significant illusion, paradoxically, comforting your concern and filling life with sense.

At least, do not underestimate importance of affections in life. It is not just that achieving goals. It is more profound.
