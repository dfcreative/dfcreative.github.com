Design is bringing ideas from unlimited world of possibilities and fantasies. It’s feeling-led process.

Code (markup) is semantic fixing and describing (working out) ideas. It’s rigid thing, it’s avoiding unecessary things, it’s cutting shit up.

That’s why you cannot merge markup with design. For design you should have possibility to make what you see naturally and straight, to develop fantasy.
