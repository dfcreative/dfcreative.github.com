To form perfect front-end process.

* Taniaâ€™s duty is making research and obtaining requirements.
* My duty is making prototypes and writing plugins.
* Frontender's duty is implementing prototypes, closing bugs and optimizing things.

For my primary duty I have to create my own process.

As an imput I have requirements.

I have to do designs (2-3 different versions), implement one of them as a prototype, test on different data.

My workshop:

* PS + plugins (painting a design, experimenting, making sources for markup)
* Prototyping framework
