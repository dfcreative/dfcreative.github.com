Required `Jekyl` to make it work.

# TODO

* Make it fully on require.js with loading of .md as a dependencies. Maybe use require for client md editor?

# Statements

* Data should be kept in nice md format in different files.
* Site should be fully kept on github, without databases
* It should be fully ajax, of course.
* Inputting of information should be facilitated by maximum. I think, designer’s kit might be ok for that.
* It should be fully available offline.
* There should be a special feed of ideas, ponos-like. They are rich in sketches.
* Post should include: data, caption, category-icon, taglist, enhanced cut, commentaries.
* I think, there should be a timeline, not just bunch of post-rupts. It’s difficult to look through current masonry layout.
* Search, of course: categories should be there, not aside. It’s search needs.
* Posts should be presented as separate pages
